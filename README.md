# Advent of Code 2021

It's that time of year again, Happy Holidays everyone! Will I make it more than halfway before I can't solve them anymore?

## Ideas (Half Baked)

- Try making a fairly attractive CLI application with PyInquirer
- Be vigiliant about tests
- Be able to run all days at once, or one at a time, with all inputs centralized
- Use numpy because I hear it's pretty good for mathy things
