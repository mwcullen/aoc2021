# Advent of Code 2021

It's that time of year again, Happy Holidays everyone! Will I make it more than halfway before I can't solve them anymore?

## Ideas (Half Baked)

~~- Try making a fairly attractive CLI application with PyInquirer~~
- I think we're going web dev with Flask and Angular

- Be vigiliant about tests
- Be able to run all days at once, or one at a time, with all inputs centralized
- Try to use numpy because I hear it's pretty good for array things

## This plan is currently in disarray because December snuck up on me, currently stanalone day solutions are located in the ao2021_py file
